    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This dish is an esteemed delicacy even though many people percieve it as a "crude" dish.
        But these people are incredibly foolish and uncultured (understandably so) because only the finest palates may see the beauty of this divine combination of rich flavors.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>cooked rice</li>
        <li>mayonnaise (must be near expiration date for optimum flavor)</li>
        <li>plate and spoon (both optional)</li>
    </ul>
